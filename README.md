# Genetasis
A Game/Emulation based upon the concepts of a genetic algorithm built in Java and openGL with LWJGL

When running the simulation several graphs will open stacked ontop of each other, drag them elsewhere, preferably to a second monitor to see them all.
Graphs can be resized and the potting area can be dragged to adjust ranges.


Controls:

WASD to pan camera

Z and X to lower/raise camera height

MOUSE:

left click and drag to pan
left click to highlight entities


Settings:

Enter Main class and set polygon mode to true to see raw meshes
Set unlock framerate to true to attempt to run the simulation at a higher framerate
